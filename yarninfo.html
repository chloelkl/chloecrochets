                    <a href="https://memo-arthouse.com/" target="_blank">Memo's Arthouse!</a> My absolute favourite
                    favourite place to shop for my yarn.
                    With just $0.80 per 50g ball of yarn, $1 for 100g of stuffing etc, each of my projects costs less
                    than $5!
                    If the location is on the further side of Singapore, their items can be bought on their website or
                    <a href="https://shopee.sg/memo.arthouse" target="_blank">Shopee</a> (costs slightly more but it is
                    still cheap!).
                    <br><br>
                    Considering the price, the quality of their products is excellent, the yarn is comfortable when used
                    as wearables and it is nowhere near scratchy.

                    <p>I LOVE milk cotton yarn, especially the Cow brand. 
                        They're 80% cotton and 20% acrylic so they're really soft and perfect for both wearables and amiguruni.
                        I use 4-5 ply so sometimes my hook does get trapped in between the yarn, but now a lot less after crocheting for a long time.
                        <br><br>
                        Before I found out about the existence of milk cotton yarn, I used acrylic yarn from Daiso. No hate to Daiso, but I do not recommend using their yarn. 
                        The yarn is too scratchy and for $2 per ball, it is not worth it.
                        After trying out cotton milk yarn, I'm not going back to anything else!

                <h2>About my hooks</h2>
                <div>
                    <img src="images/abouttools/daisohooks.jpg" alt="hooks from Daiso">
                    <p>
                        Many crocheters have a LOT of hooks; 2mm, 2.5mm, 3mm, 3.5mm, etc. And while I really respect that, I'm too broke to have a whole collection of hooks.
                        I only have two of them, 3.5mm and 5mm. Both are bought from Daiso and the quality of the hook is not bad! 
                        I've been using it for four years and it hasn't fallen apart.
                        <br><br>
                        I always use my 3.5mm hook for amigurunis and 5mm for wearables. 
                        Together with my 5 ply yarn, just having these two hooks makes my project the perfect size; 
                        stuffing doesn't stick out of my stuffed animals, and it isn't painful to crochet so many stitches for clothes.

                <h2>About my amiguruni tools</h2>
                <div>
                    <img src="images/abouttools/safetyeyes.png" alt="">
                    <p>
                        I had been using substitutes for both amiguruni eyes and stuffing because I did not want to spend extra money on those.
                        However, using black yarn for their eyes did not give them enough life and honestly, it just looked ugly.
                        Using scrap yarn as stuffing also did not give them enough fluff.
                        <br><br>
                        So of course, when I came across Memo's Arthouse, I bought 9mm safety eyes in addition to 100g of stuffing and I have no regrets!
                        The safety eyes looked confusing to use at first but really, it's simple. 
                        9mm is also not too big or too small for all my amiguruni projects.

                    <p>
                        You may be wondering why there is a picture of paper clips in a crochet blog. 
                        But they are SO useful. I use them as substitutes for stitch markers, my life hack!
                        <br><br>
                        As I go deeper into crocheting, I'd start questioning my ability to COUNT.
                        If I counted the number of times I lost count while crocheting, I'd lose count again.
                        That's why stitch markers are important!
                        Others use safety pins instead but I have a box of paper clips so I use those.
